Comments:
# --> Single line command
: ' data ' --> Multi line command

Operators:
-eq  --> Equal to
-ne  --> Not Equal to
-gt  --> Greater than
-lt  --> Less than
-ge  --> Greater than equal to
-le  --> Less than equal to

If condition:
Example: Count equals to 10, then it will result true or else false, below is script:

count=10
if [ $count -ne 9 ]
then
    echo "True"
else
    echo "False"
fi
Result: True

Example2:

Age=35
if [ $Age -lt 18 ] && [ $Age -gt 65 ]
then
	echo "You are Eligible for Vote..!"
else
	echo "Not Eligible for Vote..!"
fi
Result: You are eligible for vote..!

Example3:
elif condition
count=9

if [ $count -gt 9 ]
then
	echo "First Statement is true"
elif [ $count -lt 9 ]
then
	echo "Second Statement is true"
elif [ $count -eq 9 ]
then
	echo "Third Statement is true"
else
	echo "False"
fi
Result: Third statement is true

STRINGS:
Example1:
#! /bin/bash

echo "Enter First String : "
read str1
echo "Enter Second String : "
read str2

if [ $str1 == $str2 ]
then
	echo "Strings Match"
else
	echo "Strings doesn't match"
fi
Result: when you run the script (It is a case sensitive):
Enter First String:
Hello
Enter Second String:
hello
Strings doesn't match

Result: when you run the script:
Enter First String:
Hello
Enter Second String:
Hello
Strings Match

Example2:
#! /bin/bash

echo "Enter First String"
read str1
echo "Enter Second String"
read str2

if [ "$str1" \< "$str2" ]
then
	echo "$str1 is smaller than $str2"
elif [ "$str1" \> "$str2" ]
then
	echo "$str1 is greater than $str2"
else
	echo "Both strings are equal"
fi
Result: when you run the script:
Enter First String:
Hello
Enter Second String:
hello
Output: Hello is smaller than hello

Result: when you run the script:
Enter First String:
Hello
Enter Second String:
Hello
Output: Both strings are equal

Example3:
#! /bin/bash

echo "Enter First String"
read str1
echo "Enter Second String"
read str2
c=${str1^}${str2^^}
echo $c
#^ --> Lower case
#^^ --> Upper Case
#^l --> Proper Case (First Letter Capitalize)
Result: Append the two strings
Enter First String:
HEllo
Enter Second String:
world
Output: helloWORLD

Example4:
#! /bin/bash

echo "Enter First String"
read str1
echo "Enter Second String"
read str2
echo "Enter Third String"
read str3
c=${str1^}${str2^^} ${str2^l}
echo $c
Result: Append the multiple strings
Enter First String:
HEllo
Enter Second String:
world
Output: helloWORLD
